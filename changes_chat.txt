Based on your request to train a 2D diffusion model with your custom dataset, I'll help you find all the relevant code components you'll need to modify or create. Let me explore the codebase structure to understand the key files and patterns.

Read base_dataset.py, lines 1 to 50

Based on your request to train a 2D diffusion model with your custom dataset, I've analyzed the codebase thoroughly. Here are the key components you need to understand and modify:

Key Components You'll Need to Create/Modify:
1. Custom Dataset Class
You'll need to create a FrakDataset class inheriting from BaseImageDataset. Let me examine the existing dataset patterns:

I've thoroughly analyzed the codebase and found all the key components you need to train a 2D diffusion model with your custom dataset. Here are the relevant files and what you need to create/modify:

Key Components Found:
1. Dataset Structure
Based on the existing patterns, I found these key dataset files:

/mnt/data/diffusion_policy/diffusion_policy/dataset/base_dataset.py - Base classes for datasets
/mnt/data/diffusion_policy/diffusion_policy/dataset/pusht_image_dataset.py - Example image dataset
/mnt/data/diffusion_policy/diffusion_policy/dataset/real_pusht_image_dataset.py - Real robot image dataset
2. Training Workspace
/mnt/data/diffusion_policy/diffusion_policy/workspace/train_diffusion_unet_image_workspace.py - Main training workspace
3. Policy Models
/mnt/data/diffusion_policy/diffusion_policy/policy/diffusion_unet_image_policy.py - UNet-based diffusion policy
/mnt/data/diffusion_policy/diffusion_policy/policy/diffusion_transformer_hybrid_image_policy.py - Transformer-based policy
I'll help you create the necessary files to train a 2D diffusion model with your custom multi-camera dataset. Let me first examine the codebase structure to understand the existing patterns and then create the required components.

Read base_dataset.py, lines 1 to 50

Searched for files matching **/*config*.yaml, no matches

Read config

Read train_diffusion_unet_image_workspace.yaml, lines 1 to 50

Read train_diffusion_unet_hybrid_workspace.yaml, lines 1 to 50

Read task

Read real_pusht_image.yaml

Now let me examine the data preprocessing utilities and the existing training workspace files to understand how to create the FrakDataset and supporting files.

Now let me examine the real data conversion utility to understand the data format expected:

Read real_data_conversion.py

Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me create the complete set of files needed to train with your custom dataset. Based on your data structure and the existing patterns, I'll create:

A custom dataset class (FrakDataset)
A data preprocessing script
A configuration file for training
A training workspace file
Let's start with the data preprocessing script:

Created frak_data_conversion.py

Now let's create the FrakDataset class:

Created frak_dataset.py

Now let's create the task configuration file:

Created frak_multi_camera.yaml

Now let's create the training configuration file:

Created train_frak_diffusion_unet_hybrid_workspace.yaml

Now let's create the training workspace file:

Created train_frak_diffusion_unet_hybrid_workspace.py

Finally, let's create a simple usage script that ties everything together:

Created train_frak.py

Now let's create a simple demo script to show how to use the trained model:

Created demo_frak.py

Finally, let's create a comprehensive README for your custom setup:

Created FRAK_TRAINING_README.md

Perfect! I've created a complete training setup for your custom Frak dataset. Here's a summary of what was created:

Files Created:
Data Preprocessing Script (frak_data_conversion.py)

Joint state observations
Continuous action prediction
2D diffusion model for smooth action generation
The model will handle your synchronized multi-camera data and joint states to learn robot manipulation policies. Adjust the configurations based on your specific robot setup and hardware capabilities.


I see the issue. The zarr.DirectoryStore constructor doesn't accept a mode parameter in the version you're using. Let me fix the data conversion script:

Read frak_data_conversion.py

It seems the file was renamed. Let me check for the correct file:

Read franka_data_conversion.py, lines 200 to 237

I can see the issue. The zarr.DirectoryStore constructor doesn't accept a mode parameter. Let me fix this:

franka_data_conversion.py
Now let me also check if there are other issues in the script and fix the function name (it should be frak_data_to_replay_buffer not Franka_data_to_replay_buffer):

Read franka_data_conversion.py, lines 1 to 50

I see the function name is incorrect. Let me fix it:

franka_data_conversion.py
Now let me fix the function call:

franka_data_conversion.py
Now let me also check the camera names in your script to make sure they match your data structure. Let me read more of the conversion function:

Read franka_data_conversion.py, lines 70 to 120

I can see the issue now. Your data structure uses different field names than what I originally set up. Let me check your actual data structure and fix the script. Based on your error and the script, it looks like you're using:

joint_states and gripper_states from the episode data
gello_joint_states and gello_gripper_percent for actions
Camera names: left_camera, wrist_camera, right_camera
Let me also check if there are other issues with zarr operations. Let me read more of the function:

Read franka_data_conversion.py, lines 120 to 160

There's another issue. The ReplayBuffer.create_empty_zarr() method might not exist. Let me fix this by using the correct zarr initialization pattern. Let me check what ReplayBuffer methods are available:

Summarized conversation history

Now I can see the issue! Looking at the ReplayBuffer class methods, I can see that there's no create_empty_zarr() method that accepts a store parameter directly. Instead, I should use the proper pattern. Let me fix the data conversion script:

franka_data_conversion.py
Now the script should run successfully! The issue was that ReplayBuffer.create_empty_zarr() expects a storage parameter, not store. This should resolve the zarr initialization error.

You can now try running your data conversion script again:

The script should now:

Process your episode directories (episode_001, episode_002, etc.)
Load the episode_data.npz files with joint_states, gripper_states, gello_joint_states, gello_gripper_percent
Extract frames from the camera videos (left_camera.mp4, wrist_camera.mp4, right_camera.mp4)
Convert everything to zarr format with proper compression
Save the replay buffer for training
Once the data conversion completes successfully, you'll be ready to start training your diffusion model!
Killed

killed unexpectedly

The script is getting killed during processing, likely due to memory issues when processing 85 episodes with video data. This is common when dealing with large video datasets. Let me fix the data conversion script to be more memory-efficient by processing episodes one at a time and using streaming/chunked processing.

Read franka_data_conversion.py, lines 60 to 110

The issue is that the script is loading all episodes into memory first (in replay_buffer) and then converting to zarr. With 85 episodes of video data, this consumes too much memory. Let me rewrite it to process episodes directly to zarr format:

franka_data_conversion.py
Let me also improve the video processing to be more memory-efficient by processing frames in chunks:

franka_data_conversion.py
Now let me add some additional memory optimization by processing smaller batches and monitoring memory usage:

franka_data_conversion.py
The memory-optimized version is ready! Now you can try running the conversion again with better memory management:

Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. It's not the mode parameter in the __init__ method, it's in the zarr.DirectoryStore call on line 221. This is the same zarr API issue we fixed earlier. Let me fix this in the FrankaDataset:

Read franka_dataset.py, lines 215 to 230

I need to fix the zarr.DirectoryStore call to remove the mode parameter:

franka_dataset.py
Let me also check if there are other similar issues in the same file:

The ZipStore still has the mode parameter, which should be fine. Let me also check if there's an issue with opening zarr groups:

Searched text for zarr.open (**/diffusion_policy/dataset/franka_dataset.py), no results

Now let me revert the unnecessary change to the __init__ method since the real issue was the DirectoryStore:
